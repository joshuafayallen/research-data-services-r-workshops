The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO!

This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %>%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

Filling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly.\nIf you have concerns with the teamwork and/or contribution from any team members, please email me by the project video deadline. You only need to email me if you have concerns. Otherwise, I will assume everyone on the team equally contributed and will receive full credit for the teamwork portion of the grade."

Much like writing a sentence there is a proper grammar to it. Once we understand the rules we can construct lots of different “sentences”.\nI think an important theme so to say is that once we start to understand R it benefits your workflow because we can simply tweak a few things and then BAM it will just update. If you are a Latex user then bam the same plot just updates. If you are a word user then those benefits are limited but ggplots play nicely with Word. No having to put replace everywhere or screenshot things."

download a shapefile you will get lots and lots of stuff. Lots of the shapefiles that you encounter in the wild are maintained by governments so keep those in the working directory. I will get to how to read in shape files in a minute. But when you read them into R the only thing that changes from your usual dataframe, tibble, data.table etc is that you will get a column in your dataset called geometry. This is just a list of things that delineate boundaries. for smaller countries like Fiji the number of boundaries are going to be smaller than say larger countries by area. It doesnt make sense to us but it makes sense to R"

If you collaborate with people now or in the future they are going to have to manually set the working directory on their computer. Each time.\nR projects are great because they will just set the working directory to wherever the project is living. The additional benefit is that it will restart R. Which is good because R will just keep lots of packages loaded in the background. This can cause what are called namespace conflicts. This used to be really bad with plyr and dplyr but plyr has since been retired. Truly problematic namespace conflicts are not something that I have experienced but they do happen. Fresh R sessions are the easiest way to avoid them"

Objects are what we work with in R they can be various classes. The class of an object sets out strict limitations on what R can do with those objects but just as importantly it tells R what it can’t do with those objects. While sometimes it is frustrating because sometimes you just want to do a thing it helps you protect your from yourself.\nEverything that exists in R is an object because they are data which can be manipulated. And (almost) everything that happens is a function call, which is an evaluation of this object which gives you another object"

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website at sta210-s22.github.io/website.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Sakai, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course forum Conversations. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Conversations before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, I encourage you to respond!\nEmails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. If you email me, please include “STA 210” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 210 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources."

Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded. In addition to application exercises will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for the course is comprised of six components: application exercises, homework assignments, labs, exams, projects, and teamwork.\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Tuesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59 pm ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are due Sunday by 11:59 pm ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s GitHub repository on the course’s GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be three, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content, and they may also include small analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic integrity\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nStudents affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects. Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Jeanna McCullers (jeanna.mccullers@duke.edu), Director of the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel and our head TA Rick Presman before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nAll lectures will be recorded and available on Panopto, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures. If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board."

But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course.

    "text": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)\nTo understand the formulas for AIC and BIC, we will first briefly explain the likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimates for regression.\nLet \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) be \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix of responses, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), the \\(n \\times (p+1)\\) matrix of predictors, and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), \\((p+1) \\times 1\\) matrix of coefficients. If the multiple linear regression model is correct then,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y} \\sim N(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhen we do linear regression, our goal is to estimate the unknown parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) from Equation 1. In Matrix Notation for Multiple Linear Regression, we showed a way to estimate these parameters using matrix alegbra. Another approach for estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is using maximum likelihood estimation.\nA likelihood function is used to summarise the evidence from the data in support of each possible value of a model parameter. Using Equation 1, we will write the likelihood function for linear regression as\n\\[\nL(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\bigg\\}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) response and \\(\\mathbf{X}_i\\) is the vector of predictors for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation. One approach estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is to find the values of those parameters that maximize the likelihood in Equation 2, i.e. maximum likelhood estimation. To make the calculations more manageable, instead of maximizing the likelihood function, we will instead maximize its logarithm, i.e. the log-likelihood function. The values of the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function are those that maximize the likelihood function. The log-likelihood function we will maximize is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) &= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are \\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y} \\hspace{10mm} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{n}RSS\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(RSS\\) is the residual sum of squares. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate is not exactly equal to the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) we typically use \\(\\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}\\). This is because the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) in Equation 4 is a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\). When \\(n\\) is much larger than the number of predictors \\(p\\), then the differences in these two estimates are trivial."

    "text": "Hat Matrix & Leverage\nRecall from the notes Matrix Form of Linear Regression that \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) can be written as the following:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nCombining Equation 4 and Equation 5, we can write \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\) as the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} &= \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe define the hat matrix as an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix of the form \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\). Thus Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix are a measure of how far the predictor variables of each observation are from the means of the predictor variables. For example, \\(h_{ii}\\) is a measure of how far the values of the predictor variables for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation, \\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\), are from the mean values of the predictor variables, \\(\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_2, \\ldots, \\bar{x}_p\\). In the case of simple linear regression, the \\(i^{th}\\) diagonal, \\(h_{ii}\\), can be written as\n\\[\nh_{ii} =  \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nWe call these diagonal elements, the leverage of each observation.\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq h_ii \\leq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = p+1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nThe mean hat value is \\(\\bar{h} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}}{n} = \\frac{p+1}{n}\\).\n\nUsing these properties, we consider a point to have high leverage if it has a leverage value that is more than 2 times the average. In other words, observations with leverage greater than \\(\\frac{2(p+1)}{n}\\) are considered to be high leverage points, i.e. outliers in the predictor variables. We are interested in flagging high leverage points, because they may have an influence on the regression coefficients.\nWhen there are high leverage points in the data, the regression line will tend towards those points; therefore, one property of high leverage points is that they tend to have small residuals. We will show this by rewriting the residuals from Equation 4 using Equation 7.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e} &= \\mathbf{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y} \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nNote that the identity matrix and hat matrix are idempotent, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}\\), \\(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}\\). Thus, \\((\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{H})\\) is also idempotent. These matrices are also symmetric. Using these properties and Equation 8, we have that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\), is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\mathbf{e}) &= \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^T \\\\[10pt]\n&=  (1-\\mathbf{H})Var(\\mathbf{Y})^T(1-\\mathbf{H})^T \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})^T  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})(1-\\mathbf{H})  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{n-p-1}\\) is the estimated regression variance. Thus, the variance of the \\(i^{th}\\) residual is \\(Var(e_i) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii})\\). Therefore, the higher the leverage, the smaller the variance of the residual. Because the expected value of the residuals is 0, we conclude that points with high leverage tend to have smaller residuals than points with lower leverage."

Therefore, we use the model in Equation 2 for interpretations and predictions, we will use Equation 3 to state our conclusions in terms of \\(y\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\exp\\{\\log(y)\\} = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\} \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\} \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIn order to interpret the slope and intercept, we need to first understand the relationship between the mean, median and log transformations.\n\nMean, Median, and Log Transformations\nSuppose we have a dataset y that contains the following observations:\n\n\n[1] 3 5 6 7 8\n\n\nIf we log-transform the values of y then calculate the mean and median, we have\n\n\n\n\n\nmean_log_y\nmedian_log_y\n\n\n\n\n1.70503\n1.79176\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we calculate the mean and median of y, then log-transform the mean and median, we have\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_mean\nlog_median\n\n\n\n\n1.75786\n1.79176\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simple illustration to show\n\n\\(\\text{Mean}[{\\log(y)}] \\neq \\log[\\text{Mean}(y)]\\) - the mean and log are not commutable\n\\(\\text{Median}[\\log(y)] = \\log[\\text{Median}(y)]\\) - the median and log are commutable\n\n\n\nInterpretaton of model coefficients\nUsing Equation 2, the mean \\(\\log(y)\\) for any given value of \\(x\\) is \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\); however, this does not indicate that the mean of \\(y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}\\) (see previous section). From the assumptions of linear regression, we assume that for any given value of \\(x\\), the distribution of \\(\\log(y)\\) is Normal, and therefore symmetric. Thus the median of \\(\\log(y)\\) is equal to the mean of \\(\\log(y)\\), i.e \\(\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\).\nSince the log and the median are commutable, \\(\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\Rightarrow \\text{Median}(y) = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}\\). Thus, when we log-transform the response variable, the interpretation of the intercept and slope are in terms of the effect on the median of \\(y\\).\nIntercept: The intercept is expected median of \\(y\\) when the predictor variable equals 0. Therefore, when \\(x=0\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 = \\beta_0 \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInterpretation: When \\(x=0\\), the median of \\(y\\) is expected to be \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\).\nSlope: The slope is the expected change in the median of \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) increases by 1 unit. The change in the median of \\(y\\) is\n\\[\n\\exp\\{[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x]\\} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}} = \\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\n\\]\nThus, the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x+1\\) is \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\) times the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x\\).\nInterpretation: When \\(x\\) increases by one unit, the median of \\(y\\) is expected to multiply by a factor of \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\)."

    "text": "Exercises\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic, many states made alternatives in-person voting, such as voting by mail, more widely available for the 2020 U.S. election. The general consensus was that voters who were more Democratic leaning would be more likely to vote by mail, while more Republican leaning voters would largely vote in-person. This was supported by multiple surveys, including this survey conducted by Pew Research.\nThe goal of this analysis is to use regression analysis to explore the relationship between a county’s political leanings and the proportion of votes cast in-person in 2020. The ultimate question we want to answer is “Did counties with more Republican leanings have a larger proportion of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election?”\nWe will use the proportion of votes cast for Donald Trump in 2016 (pctTrump_2016) as a measure of a county’s political leaning. Counties with a higher proportion of votes for Trump in 2016 are considered to have more Republican leanings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll narrative should be written in complete sentences, and all visualizations should have informative titles and axis labels.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Counties in North Carolina\nFor this part of the analysis, we will focus on counties in North Carolina. We will use the data sets election_nc and county_map_data.\n\nVisualize the distribution of the response variable inperson_pct and calculate appropriate summary statistics. Use the visualization and summary statistics to describe the distribution. Include an informative title and axis labels on the plot.\nLet’s view the data in another way. Use the code below to make a map of North Carolina with the color of each county filled in based on the percentage of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election. Fill in title and axis labels.\nThen use the plot answer the following:\n\nWhat are 2 - 3 observations you have from the plot?\nWhat is a feature that is apparent in the map that wasn’t apparent from the histogram in the previous exercise? What is a feature that is apparent in the histogram that is not apparent in the map?\n\n\n\nelection_map_data <- left_join(election_nc, county_map_data)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = county_map_data,\n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n    fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"white\"\n    ) +\n  geom_polygon(data = election_map_data, \n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,\n    fill = inperson_pct)\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"___\",\n    y = \"___\",\n    fill = \"___\",\n    title = \"___\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  coord_quickmap()\n\n\nCreate a visualization of the relationship between inperson_pct and pctTrump_2016. Use the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t yet done so, now is a good time to render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe can use a linear regression model to better quantify the relationship between the variables.\n\nFit the linear model to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nWrite the regression equation using mathematical notation.\n\nNow let’s use the model coefficients to describe the relationship.\n\nInterpret the slope. The interpretation should be written in a way that is meaningful in the context of the data.\nDoes it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the data. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.\n\nIf the linear model is a good fit to these data, there should be no structure left in the residuals and the residuals should have constant variance. Augment the data with the model to obtain the residuals and predicted values for each observation, and call the augmented data frame nc_election_aug (You will use this name in Exercise 8). Then, make a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values, and based on this plot, and provide a brief explanation for whether these two conditions are met. Hint: Zoom out on the plot by extending the limits of the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNow is a good time to render your document again if you haven’t done so recently and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe might also be interested in our observations being independent, particularly if we are to use these data for inference. To evaluate whether the independence condition is met, we will examine a map of the counties in North Carolina with the color filled based on the value of the residuals.\n\nBriefly explain why we may want to view the residuals on a map to assess independence.\nBriefly explain what pattern (if any) we would expect to observe on the map if the independence condition is satisfied.\n\nFill in the name of your model in the code below to calculate the residuals and add them to election_map_data. Then, a map with the color of each county filled in based on the value of the residual. Hint: Start with the code from Exercise 2.\nIs the independence condition satisfied? Briefly explain based on what you observe from the plot.\n\nnc_election_aug <- nc_election_aug %>% \n  bind_cols(fips = election_nc$fips)\n\nelection_map_data <- left_join(election_map_data, nc_election_aug)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the next part, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Inference for the U.S.\nTo get a better understanding of the trend across the entire United States, we analyze data from a random sample of 200 counties. This data is in the election_sample data frame. Because these counties were randomly selected out of the 3,006 counties in the United States, we can reasonably treat the counties as independent observations.\n\nFit the linear model to these sample data to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nConduct a hypothesis test for the slope using a permutation test. In your response, state the null and alternative hypotheses in words, and state the conclusion in the context of the data.\nNext, construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope using bootstrapping. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the data.\nComment on whether the hypothesis test and confidence interval support the general consensus that Republican voters were more likely to vote in-person in the 2020 election? A brief explanation is sufficient but it should be based on your conclusions from Exercises 10 and 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore submitting, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates."

Two friends, Elliott and Adrian, want to build a model predicting typing speed (average number of words typed per minute) from whether the person wears glasses or not. Before building the model they want to conduct some exploratory analysis to evaluate the strength of the association between these two variables, but they’re in disagreement about how to evaluate how strongly a categorical predictor is associated with a numerical outcome. Elliott claims that it is not possible to calculate a correlation coefficient to summarize the relationship between a categorical predictor and a numerical outcome, however they’re not sure what a better alternative is. Adrian claims that you can recode a binary predictor as a 0/1 variable (assign one level to be 0 and the other to be 1), thus converting it to a numerical variable. According to Adrian, you can then calculate the correlation coefficient between the predictor and the outcome. Who is right: Elliott or Adrian? If you pick Elliott, can you suggest a better alternative for evaluating the association between the categorical predictor and the numerical outcome?\nHigh correlation, good or bad? Two friends, Frances and Annika, are in disagreement about whether high correlation values are always good in the context of regression. Frances claims that it’s desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated to each other when building linear models. Annika claims that while it’s desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be highly correlated with each other. Who is right: Frances, Annika, both, or neither? Explain your reasoning using appropriate terminology.\nTraining for the 5K. Nico signs up for a 5K (a 5,000 metre running race) 30 days prior to the race. They decide to run a 5K every day to train for it, and each day they record the following information: days_since_start (number of days since starting training), days_till_race (number of days left until the race), mood (poor, good, awesome), tiredness (1-not tired to 10-very tired), and time (time it takes to run 5K, recorded as mm:ss).

Should they include all variables shown above in their model? Why or why not?\nMultiple regression fact checking. Determine which of the following statements are true and false. For each statement that is false, explain why it is false.\n\nIf predictors are colinear, then removing one variable will have no influence on the point estimate of another variable’s coefficient.\nSuppose a numerical predictor \\(x\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 2.5\\) in a multiple regression model. Suppose also that the first observation has \\(x_{1,1} = 7.2\\), the second observation has a value of \\(x_{2,1} = 8.2\\), and these two observations have the same values for all other predictors. Then the predicted value of the second observation will be 2.5 higher than the prediction of the first observation based on the multiple regression model.\nIf a regression model’s first predictor has a coefficient of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 5.7\\) and if we are able to influence the data so that an observation will have its \\(x_1\\) be 1 larger than it would otherwise, the value \\(\\hat{y}_1\\) for this observation would increase by 5.7."

We will consider the following conditions to describe the decisions:\n\nlineup: How potential suspects are shown to the participants\n\nSimultaneous Lineup: Participants were shown photos of all 6 potential suspects at the same time and were required to make a single decision (identify someone from the lineup or reject the lineup).\nSequential 5 Lineup: Photos of the 6 suspects were shown one at a time. The participant was required to make a decision (choose or don’t choose) as each photo was shown. Once a decision was made, participants were not allowed to reexamine a photo. If the participant made an identification, the remaining photos were not shown. In each of these lineups the true perpetrator was always the 5th photo in the lineup.\n\nweapon: Whether or not a weapon was present in the video of the mock crime.\nfeature: Whether or not the perpetrator had a distinctive marking on his face. In this experiment, the distinctive feature was a large “N” sticker on one cheek. (The letter “N” was chosen to represent the first author’s alma mater - University of Nebraska.)\n\nThe data may be found in eyewitness.csv in the data folder.\n\new <- read_csv(here::here(\"hw\", \"data/eyewitness.csv\"))\new <- ew %>%\n  mutate(id = as_factor(id))"

    "text": "Part 2 - GDP and Urban population\nData on countries’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and percentage of urban population was collected and made available by The World Bank in 2020. A description of the variables as defined by The World Bank are provided below.\n\nGDP: “GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars.”\nUrban Population (% of total): “Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects.”\n\nThe data can be found in the data folder of your repository. Read the data and name it gdp_2020.\n\nFit a model predicting GDP from urban population. Then make a plot of residuals vs. fitted for this model. Does the linear model seem appropriate for modeling this relationship? Explain your reasoning.\nAdd a new column to the gdp_2020 dataset called gdp_log which is the (natural) log of gdp.\nFit a new model, predicting the log of GDP from urban population. Then make a plot of residuals vs. fitted for this model. Does the model predicting logged GDP or original GDP appear to be a better fit? Explain your reasoning.\n\nThe model output for predicting logged GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n6.107\n0.202\n30.291\n0\n\n\nurban\n0.042\n0.003\n13.769\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear model for predicting log of GDP can be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\log(GDP)} = 6.11 + 0.042 \\times urban\n\\]\nTherefore, the coefficient of urban (0.042) can be interpreted as the change in logged GDP associated with 1 percentage point increase in urban population. The problem is, logged GDP is not a very informative value to talk about. So we need to undo the transformation we’ve done.\nTo do so, let’s do a quick review of some properties of logs.\n\nSubtraction and logs: \\(log(a) − log(b) = log(\\frac{a}{b})\\)\nNatural logarithm: \\(e^{log(x)} = x\\)\n\nBased on the interpretation of the slope above, the difference between the predicted values of logged GDP for a given value of urban and a value that is 1 percentage point higher is 0.0425. Let’s write this out mathematically, and then use the properties we’ve listed above to work through the equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nlog(\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1) - log(\\text{GDP for urban } x) &= 0.042 \\\\\nlog\\Big( \\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} \\Big) &= 0.042 \\\\\ne^{log\\Big( \\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} \\Big)} &= e^{0.042}\\\\\n\\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} &= e^{0.042}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nBased on the derivation above, fill in the blanks in the following sentence for an alternative (and more useful interpretation) of the slope of urban.\n\nFor each additional percentage point the urban population is higher, the GDP of a country is expected to be ___, on average, by a factor of ___."
