These are awesome to share on social media i.e. linkedin which is a good signal
to potential employers that you know this stuff

## Packages You Will Need 


```{r eval=FALSE}

pacman::p_load("sandwich", "lmtest", "marginaleffects", "emmeans", "modelsummary", "broom",
               "caret", "tidyverse", "fixest", "kableExtra", "nullabor", "plm", "ggfortify", install = TRUE)
set.seed(1994)

penguins = palmerpenguins::penguins 

```




:::{.notes}
Note this workshop is not a workshop that will teach you how these methods work. I presume that most of you will be familiar with linear regression and maximum likelihood estimation. If any of you are here with more of a machine learning background this includes logit and what not. 

I also assume you know the basics of indexing I will go through a bit of it but you should probably know that before doing data analysis 

This workshop is going to sort of through building the results section of a paper. This will generally be geared toward a social science audience. But the fundamentals are virtually the same if you are not.

# Exploratory Data Analysis in R {background-color="`r clrs[3]`" .white}





## Describing Variables 

- This depends on what kind of variable it is i.e. continuous, categorical etc

- It also depends on what story you need to tell
  - Is this confounder a big deal?
  - Do we see anticipation of treatment?
  - Are there any outliers?
  - etc?
  
- Remember R is just a toolbox. 



:::{.notes}
Exploratory data analysis is the first step of any data analysis pipeline. You need to understand your data in order to understand how to handle things. What does the distribution look like of your outcome variable. If you are like me and ended up taking a lot of causal inference classes and or read a lot of causal inference papers lots of the first parts of papers are just presenting EDA results to convince the reader that the assumptions are met. 

Today we will be asking what is the relationship between bill length and body mass

hopefully that seems like a sensible research question. If not well the goal is just to show you how to generate descriptive statistics in R 
:::


## First Cut


```{r base-summary}
summary(penguins) 

```




:::{.notes}
If we just want like the quickest and dirtiest look at all the variables in our data we can use summary. Functionally this works because palmerpenguins is a small toy dataset. Thankfully for me we can access the raw data that the penguins dataset is based on. This is just the penguins raw function in the palmer penguins packagte. 
:::



## Summary with a bigger data frame 

```{r}
penguins_bigger = palmerpenguins::penguins_raw

summary(penguins_bigger)

```

:::{.notes}
As you can see you can that if you like a somewhat big data frame it can get a little unruly quickly because it is going to spit out a description for every column in your data set. If you want a single variable than you can just the dollar sign to index by name. We can also get each measure we want individually  
:::



## Getting Some Descriptive Statistics 
### The Mean
:::columns
:::column
### Base 

```{r}
mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

:::

:::column
### Tidyverse(overkill in this application)

```{r}
summarise(penguins, mean(body_mass_g,
                      na.rm = TRUE))
```

:::
:::




## Quartiles

:::columns 
:::column
### Base 

```{r}
quantile(penguins$bill_depth_mm,
         na.rm = TRUE,
         probs = c(.25, .50, .75))
```

:::

:::column
### Tidyverse(overkill in this instance)
```{r}
penguins |> 
  summarise(quartile_length = quantile(bill_length_mm,
                          na.rm = TRUE,
                          probs = c(.25,
                                    .50,
                                    .75)))



```

## T-tests

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="45%"}
### Index
```{r eval=FALSE}
penguins_t_test = na.omit(penguins) # can also use na.action in t.test

penguins_t_test$gentoo = ifelse(penguins_t_test$species == "Gentoo", TRUE, FALSE)

t.test(penguins_t_test$body_mass_g,
       penguins_t_test$bill_length_mm,
        var.equal = TRUE)
# this is just to show you 
# some of the options
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
penguins_t_test = na.omit(penguins) 

penguins_t_test$gentoo = ifelse(penguins_t_test$species == "Gentoo", TRUE, FALSE)

t.test(penguins_t_test$body_mass_g, penguins_t_test$bill_length_mm, var.equal = TRUE)  
```

:::

:::{.column width="45%"}

### Formula

```{r eval=FALSE}
penguins_t_test = penguins |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  mutate(gentoo = ifelse(species == "Gentoo",
                         TRUE,
                         FALSE))

t.test(flipper_length_mm ~ gentoo,
     data = penguins_t_test) 
```


```{r echo = FALSE}
penguins_t_test = penguins |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  mutate(gentoo = ifelse(species == "Gentoo",
                         TRUE,
                         FALSE))

t.test(flipper_length_mm ~ gentoo, data = penguins_t_test) 
```


:::
::::

:::{.notes}
In this case we have our first example of using of the formula. To do statsy stuff in R we generally have to use the tilde. This is just a function of how R does statistical analysis. Would and equal sign make sense here sure but like we have to use equal for lots of other stuff.

On the left we are just using the default t.test in with two vectors. R assumes that the variances are unequal and that the it is a two sided test. 


his version of the test is actually the Welch Studentâ€™s test, used when the variances of the populations are unknown and unequal

  theme_minimal()

```


:::{.notes}
Notice that when we plot by subgroup we see evidence of simpson's pardox 


Simpsonâ€™s Paradox is a statistical phenomenon where an association between two variables in a population emerges, disappears or reverses when the population is divided into subpopulations. For instance, two variables may be positively associated in a population, but be independent or even negatively associated in all subpopulations

In this case the subgroup differences tell a much different story than the overall population. So that is something that we need to be aware of

# Data Analysis in R {background-color="`r clrs[3]`" .white}



## Some Basics
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
estimator(Outcome ~ IV1 + IV2, data = your_data)

```
 

- If you want to include all the variables in your data set than you can do that with `.`

- Remember R can hold lots of datasets so we have to be explicit with where the data is coming from
  - note that we have several different datasets named `penguins_blah`
  - making sure you have kept track of the using dataset is important







## Univariate Regression 

```{r}
peng_naive = lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins)

peng_naive
```

:::{.notes}
notice that the output is fairly sparse but in the environment you have a list object in the environment. R creates these as lists because there are tons of things of various classes. So to grab them you can use broom or you can index them.
:::





## 

```{r}
peng_naive = lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins)

summary(peng_naive)
```

:::{.notes}
This is probably what you are used to seeing if you are coming over from another language 
:::



## Anova 


```{r}

anova_example = aov(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins)

#aov(peng_naive) also works

summary(anova_example)

TukeyHSD(anova_example)

```

:::{.notes}
Here we can see that at least one group is different. 

::::


## Multiple Regression 


```{r}
peng_adjust = lm(body_mass_g ~  bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + species, data = penguins)

summary(peng_adjust)

```



## Adding Things in The Formula

```{r}
peng_adjust_sq = lm(body_mass_g ~  bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + I(bill_depth_mm^2) + species, data = penguins)

summary(peng_adjust_sq)

```

:::{.notes}
The I is the isolates or inhibit function. R will parse forumulas differently than regualr R code. so ^ has a special meaning in forumla. Which can lead to things that you don't anticipate. Normally if you wanted to get the sum of two terms you would use the addition symbol to achieve this. But in the formula syntax you are now adding them as terms to the model

 from the gaze of R's formula parsing code. It allows the standard R operators to work as they would if you used them outside of a formula, rather than being treated as special formula operators.
:::



## Your Turn {background-color="`r clrs_lt[3]`"}


- Estimate a model that looks something like this

```{r eval = FALSE}

lm(flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + other_vars)

```


- Add any other variables

- what happens if you do this in the equation 

```{r eval = FALSE}

lm(flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + log(somevar))

```

- *Bonus*: change the factor levels of species so Gentoo is the reference group
  - hint: use fct_relevel or relevel


```{r echo = FALSE}

countdown::countdown(minutes = 5)

```

:::{.notes}
As good data analysts we should always check that our assumptions are met. One really good test is to just plot our fitted values against our residuals. So lets go ahead and grab them. In base you just index them via the dollar sign or brackets. In the tidyverse can get them via broom augment. They will be returned with the name of the thing you want starting with a dot. 

The reason is that the team behind broom did not want to override existing stuff

:::{.notes}
null for Breusch Pagan there is no hetrosckedasticity 

fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no heterosckedasticity. Thats awesome

Null for Breusch Godfrey is there is no serial correlation of order up to 1

We can reject the null hypothesis meaning that there is some autocorrelation in our data. 

Okay it looks like something we have violated some of our assumptions 
:::

## Your Turn(optional) {background-color="`r clrs_lt[3]`"}

- Check the assumptions of your model

- Are the regression assumptions met? 

- Look through the `lmtest` documentation to see what other tests are available.



## Fixing Our Standard Errors

- We can do this "on the fly" in R 

- There are ways to do this in the model formula with various packages 
  - But it is better to do this ["on the fly"](https://grantmcdermott.com/better-way-adjust-SEs/)





## Adjusting Our Standard Errors for Real This time 

```{r}
coeftest(peng_adjust, vcov= vcovHC)
```

:::{.notes}

Using sandwich we can adjust our standard errors like this 
:::


## A Whole Host of Standard Errors 

```{r}
vc <- list(
  "Standard"              = vcov(peng_adjust),
  "Sandwich (basic)"      = sandwich(peng_adjust),
  "Clustered"             = vcovCL(peng_adjust, cluster = ~ species),
  "Clustered (two-way)"   = vcovCL(peng_adjust, cluster = ~ species + year),
  "HC3"                   = vcovHC(peng_adjust),
  "Andrews' kernel HAC"   = kernHAC(peng_adjust),
  "Newey-West"            = NeweyWest(peng_adjust),
  "Bootstrap"             = vcovBS(peng_adjust),
  "Bootstrap (clustered)" = vcovBS(peng_adjust, cluster = ~ species)
)

```

```

:::


:::column

### Tidy

```{r}
map_version = map(vc, ~coeftest(peng_adjust, vcov = .x))
```

:::
:::


:::{.notes}
We can feed a huge list of standard errors fairly quickly it this took virtually no time. Instead of going back and adjusting a huge set of models as would be the case in other softwares where you specify standard error fixes in the model here you can simply specify it once and forget it.

:::

## What does it look like?

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| fig-align: center

modelplot(map_version, coef_omit = c("flipper_length_mm|species|Interc")) +
  coord_flip()


```



## Making Table 2 

- Model Summary is my favorite table making package
  - if you run `modelsummary::supported_models()` you will see it fits most needs
  - alternatively if you don't want to read the list and fit your model than do `modelsummary::get_estimates(model_I_fitted)` it will tell if the output is supported

- Supports a variety of formats including word
  

```{r eval= FALSE}
se_info = tibble(term = "Standard errors","iid", "robust", "bootstrap", "stata", "clustered by sex")
modelsummary(peng_adjust,
             stars = TRUE,
             coef_omit = "(Intercept)|flipper_length_mm|.*species",
             add_rows = se_info,
             vcov =  list("iid", "robust", "bootstrap", "stata", cluster = ~ sex ),
             gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared"))
```

- As you can see it also lets you adjust your standard errors 
  - You can supply it one kind of standard error
  - Or a List like I did


## The Results

## Handling Missing Data 

:::incremental
- The default in R is to use listwise deletion 

- This requires some assumptions about why the data is missing

- Sometimes we may need to impute data for missing observations
  - Multiple imputation takes guesses about what would be there using the data
  - Two of the most popular in my home discipline are MICE and AMELIA 

```{r}

mods <- list()

pengs_impute_mice = mice::mice(penguins, m = 5, printFlag = FALSE)

pengs_amelia = Amelia::amelia(as.data.frame(penguins), m = 5, p2s = 0,
                               idvars = c("species", "island", "sex"))$imputations

mods[['List Wise Deletion']] = lm(body_mass_g ~  bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + species,
   data = penguins)

mods[['Mice']] = with(pengs_impute_mice,lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + species))
mods[['Amelia']] = lapply(pengs_amelia, \(x) lm(body_mass_g ~  bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + species, data = x))

mods[['Mice']] <- mice::pool(mods[['Mice']])

mods[['Amelia']] <- mice::pool(mods[['Amelia']])

```

:::{.notes}
Missing data is a fact of life when you work with real data. So we have to deal with it. Just letting R drop it makes very strong assumptions about why the data is missing. Often times we may want to 

:::


## Lets see it in a table 

```{r}
#| echo: false
modelsummary(mods,
             gof_map = c("r.squared", "nobs", "rmse" ))

```



## Interactions 

- To include a multiplicative term we can use `*`, `:` or `/` 

- The constitutive terms will appear automatically with `*` and `/`

- In the case of `/` it returns the marginal effect 
  - As well as the correct standard errors and p-values 

:::{.notes}
The nice part about R is that you can include interactions in a few different ways. One thing is that R will include the constuitive terms for you. The slash will sort of trick R into including the full marginal effects for you. 
:::


```{r}
pengs_interact_stand = lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm * sex + species + flipper_length_mm,
                           data = peng_sans_miss_tidy)

summary(pengs_interact_stand)
```





## Full Marginal Effects way 

```{r}
pengs_interact_marg = lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm / factor(sex) + flipper_length_mm + species, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy)

summary(pengs_interact_marg)
```

:::{.notes}
So this will give you the correct marginal effects but if you want the full range of values we need our marginal effects package 

:::

## Getting Marginal Effects for Interactions 


```{r}
#| output-location: column
pengs_interact_effect = lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm  + flipper_length_mm * sex + species, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy)

plot_cco(
  pengs_interact_effect,
  effect =  "sex", 
  condition = "flipper_length_mm")



```



:::{.notes}
We may be interested in what happens when we shift the values of our continous variable. One awesome way to do this is through our marginal effects package. In this case we can look at the effect as bill_length_mm and the conditonal contrasts. plot cco  plots the contrasts (y-axis) against values of predictor(s) variable(s) (x-axis and colors). 

essentially what happens when we have an increase of some value


 So in this case this is just showing the effect when penguins take on the value of male and flipper length in increases by x amount mm


:::

## Interflex 

```{r results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
#| output-location: column

library(interflex)

peng_interflex = as.data.frame(peng_sans_miss_tidy)


interflex(Y = "body_mass_g",
          D = "sex",
          X = "flipper_length_mm",
          Z = c("bill_length_mm", "species"),
         estimator = "kernel",
         data = peng_interflex,
         theme.bw = TRUE,
         parallel = FALSE) # recommend that you set this to true


```

:::{.notes}
Interflex is also a package that I would be remiss not to bring attention to. It is by a group of political scientists. This implements some tests to ensure that there is a linear interaction effects and whether there is common support. Basically if you start to plug in values your self across the full range of flipper lenghh you may be calculating effects where there is not a ton of data making those estimates super fragile. I would probably opt for interflex in this case but I think that is just a discipline specific thing 


The kernal estimator is what they reccommend. It is more flexible because we are not imposing a strong parametric form of the relationship. It is also nice because we include any confounders. So it looks like when we increase our flipper length in mm to about 190 mm the body mass of the penguins increase to about 400 g 

:::

## Tables with multiple models 

```{r}
modelsummary(list(peng_naive, peng_adjust, pengs_interact_stand),
             stars = TRUE,
             gof_omit = ".*", ## omitting all goodness of fit for space
             coef_map = c("bill_length_mm" = "Bill Length(mm)",
                          "flipper_length_mm" = "Flipper Length(mm)",
                          "bill_length_mm:sexmale" = "Bill Length(mm) x Male Penguin"),
             vcov = "robust",
             note = "Robust Standard errors in Parenthsis")

```




## Fancy Tables 

- Often times we have multiple dv's 

- A popular strategy in Pols and Econ is to make a table with two panels
  - Where outcome 1 is in one panel and outcome two is in the bottom panel

```{r}
#| eval: false
gm <- c("r.squared", "nobs", "rmse")

panels <- list(
  list(
    lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm + species, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy),
    lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy)
  ),
  list(
    lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species + bill_length_mm, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy),
    lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy)
  )
)

modelsummary(
  panels,
  shape = "rbind",
  gof_map = gm)

```

## Output{.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: false
gm <- c("r.squared", "nobs", "rmse")

panels <- list(
  list(
    lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm + species, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy),
    lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy)
  ),
  list(
    lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species + bill_length_mm, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy),
    lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm, data = peng_sans_miss_tidy)
  )
)

modelsummary(
  panels,
  shape = "rbind",
  gof_map = gm)
```


## Fixed Effects

- Mega popular estimation strategy in Econ and Political Science

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(plm)
library(vdemdata)

vdem_feols = feols(v2x_polyarchy ~ v2x_gender + v2x_corr | year + country_id, data = vdem)

vdem_stand = lm(v2x_polyarchy ~ v2x_gender + v2x_corr + factor(year) + factor(country_id), data = vdem)

vdem_plm = plm(v2x_polyarchy ~ v2x_gender + v2x_corr + factor(year), 
  data = vdem,
  index = c("country_id"),
  model = "within")
```


:::{.notes}
There are more than a few ways to get a fixed effects regression in R my prefered way is using fixest. Because a species and island fixed effect would be a bit ridicoulous we can use star wars to demonstrate our point a bit. Feols does this in a really intuitive way. All your fixed effectgs are behi

To sort of get on with the rest of the workshop I will not spend to much time on this.  But it is stupid fast and lets you do a whole lot.
It does not have random effects tho. PLM is really useful for lots of other common panel estimators. But fixest is still the winner when it comes to]
fixed effects models.

## Performance

- Vdem has 202 country ids and 233 years 
  - Lets time them to see 

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(microbenchmark)

vdem  = vdemdata::vdem

times_fix = microbenchmark(vdem_feols = feols(v2x_polyarchy ~ v2x_gender + v2x_corr | year + country_id, data = vdem),

vdem_stand = lm(v2x_polyarchy ~ v2x_gender + v2x_corr + factor(year) + factor(country_id), data = vdem),

vdem_plm = plm(v2x_polyarchy ~ v2x_gender + v2x_corr + factor(year), 
  data = vdem,
  index = c("country_id"),
  model = "within"), times = 10)



```

```{r}
#| echo: false

summarise(`Mean Time in Seconds` = mean(time)/6e9)



```


## Generating Predictions 



```{r}
set.seed(1994)

penguins_prediction = mutate(penguins, id = row_number()) |> 
drop_na()

peng_train = penguins_prediction |> 
  sample_frac(0.7) # sample 70% of the dataset 

peng_test = anti_join(penguins_prediction, peng_train, by = "id")

peng_test$data_set = "Test" # add an indicator for what data set we have

penguins_training_model = lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm, data = peng_train)

penguins_train_plot = augment(penguins_training_model, 
                      interval = "prediction") |>
                      select(.fitted, .lower, .upper, body_mass_g, bill_length_mm) |>
                      mutate(data_set = "train")

# alterntively this works
# predict(penguins_train_plot, newdata = peng_test)

peng_predict_test = augment(penguins_training_model,
                           interval = "prediction",
                           newdata = peng_test) |> 
 select(.fitted, .lower, .upper,  body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, data_set)

all_together = rbind(penguins_train_plot,
                    peng_predict_test)
```

:::{.notes}

 It involves randomly dividing the available set of observations into two parts, a training set and a validation set or hold-out set. The model is fit on the training set, and the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in the validation set. The resulting validation set error rate â€” typically assessed using MSE in the case of a quantitative responseâ€”provides an estimate of the test error rate

## ~~Maximum Likelihood Estimation~~ <br> Machine Learning </br>

- R comes with a whole host of maximum likelihood estimators(MLE)
  - As well as user written packages 
  
- You will also probably want to load `marginaleffects` to get marginal effects of your model
  - Remember the coefficients of a MLE model are not directly interpretable

- `emmeans` is also a solid package for getting marginal effects

- Note: They do differ on what they can do and how they generate marginal effects
  - Andrew Heiss has a nice summary of this [at the bottom of this blog post](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/05/20/marginalia/##tldr-overall-summary-of-all-these-marginal-effects-approaches)





## The data we are using 

```{r}
penguins_glm = penguins |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  mutate(big_penguin = ifelse(body_mass_g > median(body_mass_g), 1,0),
         big_penguin_logic = ifelse(body_mass_g > median(body_mass_g), TRUE, FALSE),
         female = ifelse(sex == "female", TRUE, FALSE))


```







## Lets See What this looks like 


```{r }
#| output-location: column

ggplot(penguins_glm,
    aes(x = bill_length_mm,
       y = big_penguin)) +
  stat_dots(aes(side = ifelse(big_penguin == 0,
       "top",
       "bottom")),
       scale = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm",
  method.args = list(family = binomial(link = "logit"))) +
  theme_minimal()
```






## Our Model 
```{r}
base_model = glm(big_penguin ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + species + female,
                 data = penguins_glm,
                 family = binomial(link = "logit"))

summary(base_model)
```







## Getting Interpretable Quantities 

```{r }
#| output-location: column

# get odds ratio

odds_ration = exp(coef(base_model))

avg_marginal_effect = base_model |> 
  marginaleffects()  |> 
  tidy()

ggplot(data = filter(avg_marginal_effect,
       !term == "species"),
       aes(x = estimate,
           y = str_to_title(term))) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = conf.low,
                     xmax = conf.high)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  labs(y = NULL,
       x = "Average Marginal Effect") +
  theme_minimal()


```

:::{.notes}
Since our coefficients in our logit model are uninterpretable we need to get some interpretable quantities. We can either use odds ratios by just doing exponeniate. 

This is fine if your discipline does this. Political scientists especially prefer using average marginal effects. 

Under the hood what is going on is that marginal effects is going to plug in the each row into the model and generate predictions and calculates the slope. Then will basically average across them. So the effect is basically just the average across the fitted results.
