## Why `ggplot2`?

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
The transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualization, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive.

-- Hadley Wickham
:::





## Why `ggplot2`?
:::incremental 

- You have probably heard of it but why use it?



- Once we understand the "grammar" making figures becomes a lot easier
  - Conveying information becomes easier
  - Lets you show off your clean, or not so clean, data
  - A coherent structure of doing things



- Flexibility
  - Tons ways to customize appearance
  - Lots of functions
  - Lots of extensions 



- Reproducibility 
  - Doesn't require you to remember each input from a drop down menu
  - Defaults to universally usable formats
  - Replaces itself automatically in your directory 

:::

:::{.notes}
ggplot2 is probably one of the most well known and event among many of the staunchest base r users well loved an well used libraries in the R ecosystem.

ggplot2 predates most of the tidyverse and the gg part refers to the grammar of graphics, more on that later. Much like writing a sentence there is a proper grammar to it. Once we understand the rules we can construct lots of different "sentences".

I think an important theme so to say is that once we start to understand R it benefits your workflow because we can simply tweak a few things and then BAM it will just update. If you are a Latex user then bam the same plot just updates. If you are a word user then those benefits are limited but ggplots play nicely with Word. No having to put replace everywhere or screenshot things or working with propietary formats. If you need to you

This is what it looks like when we start to think of the plot. Each of these are columns in our dataset that we plop into aes. Our x goes in the first slot of aes and the second slot is our y. I typically specify this myself just cuz I like to do that but that is a personal decision. The rest you need to tell ggplot to do 


hey take your data and turn it into something that you can see, like size, colour, position or shape. They also provide the tools that let you interpret the plot: the axes and legends. You can generate plots with ggplot2 without knowing how scales work

:::{.notes}
Remember when we do things in aes R will look for a column in our dataset. Importantly R will just looks for things it can do given the scope of the function. So if we put blue into the aes portion of it will plot it. But it will get confused because blue is not a column in our data set.

ggplot will take the color argument inside aes and outside aes. If we specify color inside aes than it will color things by a column in the dataset. If you specify color outside of aes ggplot will make everything that color

:::{.notes}
So we have mostly been working inside the individual geoms. However most people do not do this because it can start to get inconvenient quickly. If we work inside each individual geom than the other geom will not know what is going on and ggplot will get confused. 

Instead if you pass off our argument to the first layer that the aes argument will inheret the appropriate stuff

## Building Plots
#### Starting with Data and aesthics 



```{r complex-plot-no-geoms-show,  echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column

    y = lifeExp))
```




:::{.notes}
So far we have only walked through geoms and aesthics but we need other layers to make graphs that make sense. And are presentable to professional audiences 

:::





##  Add `geom_point`

```{r complex-plot-add-geom-point-show,  echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
ggplot(gapminder,
    aes(x = gdpPercap,
        y = lifeExp,
        color = continent)) +
  geom_point()
  
```







##  Add `geom_smooth`


```{r complex-plot-add-geom-smooth-show,  echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(gapminder,
    aes(x = gdpPercap,
       y = lifeExp,
       color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```


##  Add Change Transparency 


```{r complex-plot-change-alpha,  echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
ggplot(gapminder,
    aes(x = gdpPercap,
       y = lifeExp,
       color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth()
```





## Adjust scales with `scale_x_log10`


```{r complex-plot-add-log-show, echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "7"
ggplot(gapminder,
     aes(x = gdpPercap,
         y = lifeExp,
         color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_log10()
```








## Add axis labels and title with `labs`


```{r complex-plot-add-labs-out,  echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "8,9,10"
ggplot(gapminder,
      aes(x = gdpPercap,
          y = lifeExp,
          color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "GDP per cap",
       y = "Life Expectancy",
       title = "The Effect of GDP per cap on Life Expectancy")
```



:::{.notes}
Labs can handle a lot of arguments. there are individual functuions for the x label and y label and title. But make your like easier by just using labs. You can also modify the legend in labs but I have various success with that. I tend to modify the legend using guides or theme

:::

## Add viridis color scale


```{r complex-plot-add-viridis-show,  echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "11"
ggplot(gapminder,
      aes(x = gdpPercap,
          y = lifeExp,
          color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "GDP per cap",
       y = "Life Expectanty",
       title = "The Effect of GDP per cap on Life Expectancy") +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```










## Add theme



```{r complex-plot-add-theme-show,  echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "12"
ggplot(gapminder,
      aes(x = gdpPercap,

  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth() +

## A Grammar We Can Use


Map wealth to the x-axis, health to the y-axis, add points, color by continent, size by population, scale the x-axis with a log. Please get rid of the default theme.



```{r grammar-ggplot-example-show, echo = TRUE }
#| output-location: column

  aes(x = gdpPercap,
      y = lifeExp,
      size = pop,
      color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Income",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  theme_allen_bw() +
  guides(size = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE,
      title = "Population"),
      color = guide_legend(title = "Continent"))
```

:::{.notes}
This is roughly the prompt that I was working with. The nice part about ggplot is you can start thinking about the plot in real words and then translate that over into code. Since we have a template of where to put things we can then focus on how best to visualize our data rather than  fighting with thousands of dropdown menus

:::{.notes}
Instead of directly transforming your data ggplot allows you to do this through the scale_x function which is pretty neat. I will not go through each of them but that is pretty handy. If you want nicer looking labels you can use the scales package to make nicer looking labels. I.e adding commas to values on the x or y axis adding the dollar sign or percentage sign etc

:::{.notes}
In some cases you may want to change the coordinates of the plot to expand or contract the coordinates or in some cases just flip them without hassle. ggplot defaults to using coord_cartesian on its own but coord_cartesian can be used to zoom in on part of the plot. The coor_flip here is a bit silly but it is insanely useful for barcharts and other charts where you may have added things into aes and don't want to go back and redo it

The labs argument has a ton of flexibility. Basically if you feed something into aes you can change it in labs. I Tend to change legend labels in guides. That is just a personal preference but labs is superflexible. You will sometimes see other solutions for changing your legend.

  scale_x_log10() +
  bbc_style()

:::{.notes}
Lots of organizations use ggplot. What this means for you is that you can find themes that lots of organizations use. I know for a fact that the economist makes all their code fully available for you. So if you see a cool graph from the economist you can just go to their github and figure out how they found it.


:::


## The theme argument 

- Has lots and lots of options(94 to be exact)

- You can change basically anything you could think of in a plot
  - My ggplot theme is basically just a some tweaks to theme arguments


```{r show-theme-options, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
theme_bw() + 
theme(legend.position = "bottom",
      plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
      axis.title.y = element_text(face = "italic"))
```



## Saving your work 

```{r fake-plot, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
your_plot_here = ggplot(data, aes(x = blah, y = blah))
```
```{r ggsave-pdf, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}

ggsave("name-of-your-file.pdf",your_plot_here) 
```



```{r ggsave-examp-png, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggsave("name-of-your-file.pngs",your_plot_here)
```






# Making Maps {background-color="`r clrs[3]`" .white}






## New Packages

```{r show-packagages-map, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("sf", "tidygeocoder"))
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/rnaturalearth")
library(rnaturalearth)
library(sf)

```

- If you are on a Mac please go to the [r-spatial-website](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) if you run into problems

- The workhorse for this particular section will be `sf`

:::aside

There are some other packages like geom_map and ggmap. They still work but sf(simple features) is really great and has a ton of support and resources. 
See [this book](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)
:::


:::{.notes}
There are lots of mapping packages in R. I will only show you how to map in ggplot. You can get a really passable map in ggplot. I have included the code the Emre wrote that uses tmap. tmap is good and I have used it but once you get the hand of ggplot I think it is just easier to use ggplot than to learn how to use a new package

:::

## Mapping in R 

- R and ggplot can get you pretty far 

- The stuff from these workshops broadly apply 
  - including your dplyr verbs

- Lots of your needs to make *static* maps can be met

- Depending on what you are doing you may have to wait a bit




## Map Made By Kieran Healy 

```{r kieran-map, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewheiss/datavizs21.classes.andrewheiss.com/main/static/slides/img/12/streams-lakes-bw-100-w-01.jpg")
```






## Shape Files 

- To read in shape files you use `read_sf` you should see something that looks like this! 


```{r show-geometry,echo=FALSE}
world_map  = read_sf("data/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp")
world_map |> 
  select(4,geometry) 


```

:::{.notes}
When you download a shapefile you will get lots and lots of stuff. Lots of the shapefiles that you encounter in the wild are maintained by governments so keep those in the working directory. I will get to how to read in shape files in a minute. But when you read them into R the only thing that changes from your usual dataframe, tibble, data.table etc is that you will get a column in your dataset called geometry. This is just a list of things that delineate boundaries. for smaller countries like Fiji the number of boundaries are going to be smaller than say larger countries by area. It doesnt make sense to us but it makes sense to R 
:::


## Working with Data

- You can use dplyr to manipulate data still. 
  
```{r  echo = TRUE}
#| output-location: column


vdem_raw = vdemdata::vdem 

vdem_cleanish = vdem_raw %>% 
  select(v2x_regime, country_name, country_text_id, year) %>%

         regime_type = as.factor(regime_type)) %>% 
  arrange(ISO_A3)


world_map_fixed = world_map %>% 
  mutate(ISO_A3 = case_when(
    ## If the country name is Norway or France, redo the ISO3 code
    ADMIN == "Norway" ~ "NOR",
    ADMIN == "France" ~ "FRA",
    ## Otherwise use the existing ISO3 code
    TRUE ~ ISO_A3)) %>% 
    filter(ISO_A3 != "ATA")

As you can see this does not look fundamentally all that different from the rest of our ggplot code. We are just coloring and sizing ssutff depening on what we want. We can add annotations

## Working Without Shape Files(kind of)

- As is the case sometimes we do not have a shape file


- Don't worry `sf` has you covered 

- You just need to feed it the right things




## Making a Bespoke Shapefile 

- You can either feed it latitude and longitudes 

- Or you can feed it addresses

- Most free ones have rate limits
  - So be mindful of the size of your data


:::{.notes}
In this case if we do not have the geometry column but we have some addresses we can just geocode them to produce the column.

breweries_geocode |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = st_crs("EPSG:4326")) |> 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```


:::{.notes}
in the geocode argument you can cascade the services just in case it fails. The neat thing is that you can feed it a dataframe of addresses. What is also pretty cool is that it plays really well with other R tidyverse packages so if you scrape a website to grab a ton of addresses than you can just feed it into tidygeocoder 


from there you can use ggplot or even create interactive leaflet maps

## Mapping Atlanta

:::incremental

- Combining what we have learned we can easily map Atlanta 

- Using the osmdata package by Open Street Maps we can do lots of things

- You can also save lots of money on gifts [trust me]{.fragment}

- We can grab a host of various things we would want for a good map

- And add points of interest 

- I will just geocode some bars that pols grad students have drank at or have had to host events at.
