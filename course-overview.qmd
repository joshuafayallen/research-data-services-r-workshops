Here you will find the materials produced for the Research Data Services R workshops. The website and workshop slides were made using [quarto](https://quarto.org/) which is an awesome tool which we will ü§ûüèΩ have a workshop on some time in the future. The content of the workshop are a mashup of lots of resources that helped me learn R in particular and I will highlight on each workshops page. I strongly reccomend you check them out!
